## Surrounded by Idiots
### by Thomas Erikson 
5/5 stars

I loved my read for February which was Surrounded by Idiots. Erikson brings to life the 4 types in the DISC system:

Reds: Dominant and commanding
Yellows: Social and optimistic
Greens: Laid-back and friendly
Blues: Analytical and precise

A favorite part for me was the intro by David Bonnstetter, one of the creators for the DISC system. Because who hasn't realized that their uncle always drives the people around them, how their significant other has a hard time listening to others, or their godparent who hates change and spotlights, or their sibling who is just a little too know it all and critical.

People are always looking for real connection: Being seen and known. Maybe quietly without fuss or more brutally through fighting for it. (Not screaming or anything violent, just asking can be a fight). 

Erikson has really taken these types and made their uniqueness clear and known, along with their weaknesses. He also stronger made the case for diversity in thinking and action style for groups and companies to be successful. He showed that no type is _better_ than another, just different and how to communicate with someone who is a different color from yourself. Communication isn't just talking, its asking for tasks or even delivering bad news like criticism and thats where there are pitfalls. If we miscommunicate something, we can end up demotivating and hurting those around us. Erikson gives a blueprint to avoiding this by typing those around us by their emotional reactions to experiencing stress, anger, and change. 

A recommended read for anyone that works in groups, and especially those who lead teams. Though if you would like to just take a quiz here are two, [here](https://www.123test.com/disc-personality-test/) and [here](https://www.crystalknows.com/disc-personality-test#assessment).

If you are interested I made a small website to show how I would expect each type to want a index page on a personal website to look like, [here]().
