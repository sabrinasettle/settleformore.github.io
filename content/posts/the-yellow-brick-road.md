Recently I had a friend reach out to talk to me about APIs. It was unsurprising since they had spoken to me at the beginning of 2020 about changing into the tech sector. They asked great questions about languages and, unusually were interested in my enthusiastic explanations. You find that being into code and computers puts many into an uneasy disoriented haze while you talk about those subjects. But getting back to it, this friend was confused by Web APIs. What did they return? How did you use one? Which in turn that lead to how do you design architecture for an app. 

While languages, frameworks, and architecture are a key part of development I wanted to write an intro to Web APIs because I remember being equally confused about them. 

I titled this with a reference to the road (or APIs) which Dorothy follows through OZ to get to the Emerald City (the returning data).

First and foremost, API stands for Application Programming Interface. Lets break this down a bit:

Application -

Programming - 

Interface - 

Wikipedia:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API
"It defines the kinds of calls or requests that can be made, how to make them, the data formats that should be used, the conventions to follow, etc. It can also provide extension mechanisms so that users can extend existing functionality in various ways and to varying degrees."

By design API calls are an abstraction allowing through objects or actions because of the natural [information hiding](linkhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_hiding). Information hiding is an important part of object-oriented programming (called *encapsulation*) and dividing software into modules of functionality.

In [RESTful](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) APIs we can see this separation take place in the types of calls, though this also has something to do with Hypertext Transfer Protocol ([HTTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol)) as well.

* What does an API return?

- An object (JSON, XTML) (DATA)
- A message
- A status
