- And the end of 42 Silicon Valley
- About the legacy code of Cantina

- Point one is about the technical debt

For the most part of 2020, I have been employed as an academic's officer and staff software engineer at the experimental 42 Silicon Valley. This week I was made redundent by a move to a fully remote and online curriculum change. This move closes the campus but opens up for more part time studies for students. On this close of a part of my life I have taken some time to just sit and gather my thoughts. 

One of my main projects during my time was adding new features to some legacy code powering a web application, which will be shut down after a time due to the campus closing. This legacy code was difficult even to work with at a simple level. It solidified my opioion that its important to understand the main concepts of a chosen framework and the languages used. Bloating Rails and making Ruby look like the logic of the C language is ridiculous in the time of googling, Medium, and Youtube. Understanding that the controllers and models should stay slim in Rails, to do this: ulitize the helpers, concerns, and tasks that are already in the structure of the framework.

But why is this important? Let me tell you: the techinical debt. 

The amount of time for building those features took double the time because the code base was a jungle of incorrect controller names and werid join tables, along with class methods that were not clear.

It also created more bugs. More future cleanup and time needed.

I know this could've mostly been avoided by a great base design with cosiderations for scabablitily, and also just working with the framework of your choice, rather than against its conceptual princlples.
