## Breadth-First Search (BFS)

Explores the edges and nodes on a graph. Useful for finding the shortest path on unweighted graphs

It starts at an arbitrary node, explores the neighbors of that node then the next level, and the next after that.

### O notation

- Best - O(V + E), V being for vertices and E for Edges
- Worst - O(V + E), V being for vertices and E for Edges
