These are my ongoing hacks for problems I have encountered while writing HTML and CSS. They will focus on CSS and some SASS the preprocessor. It will be ongoing, and be updated in future so if you like it check back every once and a while.


1. How to have the page not pop or bounce on scroll:
```overscroll-behavior: none;```

2. Keeping a footer at the bottom:
``` footer {
        position: fixed;
        bottom: 0;
        text-align: center;
    }
```
