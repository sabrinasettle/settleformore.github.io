The time of Covid-19 has been a strange time for all, and has created at least a few pages in history textbooks to come. But for those who are students or just starting their career, its a very interesting time.
I have been so lucky to have remote work from a position held at my school during the lockdown and all the uncertainty. 
Its clear to me that I become lethargic and depressed when I don't have work to send energy into, but this time period is unusual and surreal, so what should work look like?

Well in my case it's to be forgiving, to congratulate myself on small milestones, and to allow for space and breathe. Productivity is an amazing aspect of the human condition, just as ambition is. Great civilizations and persons are built with luck, determination, and ambition. So in this slow period I have not retreated but found a balance of working for others and for myself. This is done by determining steps, which side projects to do first, allocating time in my work for walks and creative thoughtful breaks. 

I hope what ever you have done during this time has been to help yourself and to help others. Be proud of any progress this time has produced.
