The use of the fictional story arc Hero's Journey to teach Agile, DevOps, and Continous deployment principles is genius. We have seen this arc in classics like Star Wars and Lord of the Rings it makes sense quickly in layman terms as a delivery of more intense examples of workflow and IT issues. I genuinely recommend this for those early in their career in tech in development or outside of it like in sales or human resources.  </p>\n<p>I am looking forward to reading The Unicorn Project next along with following up on the books referneced in the Phoenix Project.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://gph.is/2cTgTqZ\" alt=\"Black Books\"></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Phoenix Project Book Review","path":"/blog/book-review-phoenix-project","date":"January 29th, 2021","tags":["web development","agile","book review"]}}},"pageContext":{"pathSlug":"/blog/book-review-phoenix-project"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2787721378"]}
