About

Critical thinking full stack developer with a passion for development, learning, and teaching.

As a person, I have thrown myself at solving problems. The problems have taken many forms while I was an art history student, programming teacher, and textile artist, but all taught me to be tenacious and open to new, previously unknown solutions and communicating openly. 

As a developer, I enjoy brainstorming elegant and creative solutions for complex modern problems, researching best practices, and devoting my time to the success of my projects.
