Bloating Rails and making Ruby look like the logic of the C language is ridiculous in the time of Google, Medium, public libraries, and Youtube. Researching a framework is understanding that the controllers and models should stay slim in Rails, to do this: utilize the helpers, concerns, and tasks that are already in the structure of the framework.","position":{"start":{"line":4,"column":1,"offset":407},"end":{"line":4,"column":715,"offset":1121}}}],"position":{"start":{"line":4,"column":1,"offset":407},"end":{"line":4,"column":715,"offset":1121}}},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"But why is this important?
